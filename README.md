# Tennis-Ball-Speed-AI Model-
 Using a device with a camera, place it facing perendicular to the net and run the script to  capture the speed of a tennis ball! 

 I wrote this program for my class AI project in college at The University of North Alabama. 
 
 My inspiration for this project arose from my desire to calculate my serve speed accuratly without spending money 
 on expensive services like SwingVision.
 
 The script uses displacement training data, captured displacment of the ball, and linear regression to accurat 
 predict the speed of the ball in the camera view.
